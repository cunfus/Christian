# 创世纪 - 1


`1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.` 起初神创造天地

`1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.` 地是空虚混沌，渊面黑暗。神的灵运行在水面上

`1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.` 神说，要有光，就有了光

`1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.` 神看光是好的，就把光暗分开了

`1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.` 神称光为昼，称暗为夜。有晚上，有早晨，这是头一日
