# 创世纪 - 1


`1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.` 起初神创造天地

`1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.` 地是空虚混沌，渊面黑暗。神的灵运行在水面上

`1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.` 神说，要有光，就有了光

`1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.` 神看光是好的，就把光暗分开了

`1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.` 神称光为昼，称暗为夜。有晚上，有早晨，这是头一日

`1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.` 神说，诸水之间要有空气，将水分为上下

`1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.` 神就造出空气，将空气以下的水，空气以上的水分开了。事就这样成了

`1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.` 神称空气为天。有晚上，有早晨，是第二日。

`1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.` 神说，天下的水要聚在一处，使旱地露出来。事就这样成了
